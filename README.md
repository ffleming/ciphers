# Ciphers

This gem implements simple cryptographic ciphers.  As of now, it can only do 
Vigen√®re ciphers, but more are coming as I have the time and inclination.
Because this mostly exists for my own purposes (the fun of programming it and 
CTFs), I am not currently accepting PRs for new features or ciphers.  Feel free
to fork away, though, and if you have any suggestions for what I should
implement next, I'd love to hear them!  This especially applies if the
recommendation comes with a fun puzzle that implementing it will solve!
